This is the content of the .ini file: \\
<code>
[Shortcuts]
pm = ±

[YourResults]
theory = 124.5
experiment = 12e4
my_data = 12% ± 2%
</code>
\\
This will transform this input (without space after @): 
<code> 
We want to test a theroy with @ theory 
datapoints and the experiment with @ experiment samples. 
Our results are @ my_data.
</code>
into this output: \\
We want to test a theroy with 124.5 datapoints and the experiment with 12e4 samples. Our results are 12% ± 2%.

\\
We can also add some figures. The numbers will be added dynamically.\\ 
The format is this one: 

<code>
^ Figure 1 : An example figure^
| Put your figure here | 
</code>

For example: \\

^ Figure 2 : An example figure^
| Put your figure here | 

^ Figure 3 : Another example figure^
| Put your figure here |

^ Figure 4a : A third example figure ^ Figure 4b: with two columns^
| Put your figure here | Put your figure here |

The numbers where added dynamically, and letters are added for multiple columns.\\

Ciao.
